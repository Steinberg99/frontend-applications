# frontend-applications

## üìã My concept

Hi! Welcome to my repository for the two week course frontend-applications! Here you can find the website I produced during this course.

We were tasked to create a data visualization using `D3.js` and a JavaScript framework of your choice. I decided to use `React` for this exercise. I chose to visualize temperature data of the Netherlands. I was curious if I could see the effect of global warming on temperature in my own visualisations. I used the following question as the basis of my visualizations.

- Can the effects of global warming be recognised in the monthly average temperatures per century in the Netherlands?

Feel free to clone this repository or [visit]() this site and take a look!
